      <h2>Bio</h2>

      <h4> My name is Danajae’ Ballard and I am 16 years old. I was born and raised in Chicago IL. I attended Miles Davis academy elementary school up until 3rd grade then I transferred to Gunsaulus Scholastic Academy. When I graduated in 2011 I went to Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences. During my sophomore year, I became interested in Agricultural Finance. I learned how to write checks, how to handle other financial business and i also learned how to write a resume. I chose Agricultural Finance because  it is interesting and the knowledge that I gain will be useful in the future. I have not found a college to attend after High School however it would be one in the city of Chicago. After High School i want to start making plans for my future career.</h4>
