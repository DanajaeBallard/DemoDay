      <h2>Bio</h2>

      <h4> My name is Danajae’ Ballard and I am 16 years old. I was born and raised in Chicago IL. I attended Miles Davis academy elementary school up until 3rd grade then I transferred to Gunsaulus Scholastic Academy. When I graduated in 2011 I went to Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences. During my sophomore year there I became interested in Ag Finance. We learned how to write checks, and how to handle other financial business. We also learned how to write a resume. I chose this class to be my pathway for the last two years of high school because I think it is interesting and I also think that the knowledge that I gain in this class could be used in the future. I have not chosen a college that I would like to attend but I know that it will be one in the city of Chicago. I would like to stay in Chicago and start my own business and also make plans for my future career.</h4>
