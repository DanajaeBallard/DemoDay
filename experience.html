		<h6>My Experience</h6>
		
		<h4>My experience in the Englewood Codes program exceeded my expectations.  I had a chance to experience something that teens my age typically would not have the opportunity to do.  Coming into this program, I didn't think I was going to be able to do anything like this. Learning code was not easy; however it was not as difficult as I thought it would be. We spent the first eight weeks learning code using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Twitter Bootstrap and GitHub. The last two weeks of the program we took the information learned and built individual websites as well as team websites. Not only did we learn about code but we also learned about leadership. We practiced presentations and how to present our self on social media and how to prepare our self for a job interview, we also learned how to work as a team.  I am a member of the Go Getters.  The Go Getters is a hard working team who works well together to get the job done. Without the help of the Go Getters; we would not have been able to complete many of the weekly deliverables because at some point, we all struggled with the new information. Our team quote is "teamwork builds trust and trust builds speed‚Äù.  As a team, we were able to help each other with coding and ultimately, we got the job done. At this time, I would like to thank the Go Getters for being such great team members. I would also like to thank Ms. Brooks for giving helpful advice about leadership and Mr. Drummer for giving me this opportunity and changing the way I think about technology. </h4>
